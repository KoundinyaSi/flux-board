# FluxBoard - Workflow Automation Builder

FluxBoard is a **visual workflow automation tool** that allows users to **create, visualize, and manage workflows** using an interactive **drag-and-drop interface**. Built with **Next.js**, **React Flow**, and **Zustand**, it enables seamless task execution, decision-making, and automation. You can try it out live at [https://flux-board.vercel.app/](https://flux-board.vercel.app/).

## üé® Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Using Next.js Instead of React**

- **Reason:** Next.js provides **better performance optimizations** (automatic code-splitting, static asset handling).
- **Trade-off:** Since the app is **entirely client-side**, we had to ensure all Next.js pages were marked with `"use client"`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ State Management with Zustand**

- **Reason:** Zustand provides a **lightweight, scalable, and easy-to-use store** without the boilerplate of Redux.
- **Trade-off:** We don't get deep middleware support like Redux, but for this project, **simplicity and performance were prioritized**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Using React Flow for the Workflow Canvas**

- **Reason:** React Flow is designed for **graph-based UIs**, making it **ideal for workflows**.
- **Trade-off:** **Custom styling and logic require additional effort** compared to building from scratch.

## ü§î Assumptions Made

- **Workflows are JSON-based**, meaning every node and edge configuration is stored in a structured JSON format.
- **Users can edit workflows inline**, modifying nodes without opening additional popups.
- **Performance is prioritized** over excessive UI animations.
- **Nodes can be freely connected**, assuming that users will define logic constraints externally.
